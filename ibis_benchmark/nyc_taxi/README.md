# New York City Taxi and For-Hire Vehicle Data

This benchmark analyzes data for billions of taxi and for-hire vehicle (Uber, Lyft, etc.) 
trips originating in New York City since 2009. Most of the 
[raw data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) 
comes from the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission.

This benchmark was based in a previous works did by `Todd W. Schneider` and `Mark Litwintschik`. 
Some explanations, data structure and scripts for downloading and data loading was collected from
[@toddwschneider GitHub repo](https://github.com/toddwschneider/nyc-taxi-data/). Also, this 
current document was adapted from 
`https://github.com/toddwschneider/nyc-taxi-data/blob/master/README.md`. Additionally,
the scripts in this repo use and adapt some scripts and command line from `Mark Litwintschik`
blog post [A Billion Taxi Rides in Redshift](https://tech.marksblogg.com/billion-nyc-taxi-rides-redshift.html)

The current benchmark compares the time spent for ibis expressions executed on OmniSciDB CPU and GPU 
and the respective expression on pure Pandas.

Statistics through June 30, 2019:

- 2.45 billion total trips
  - 1.65 billion taxi
  - 800 million for-hire vehicle
- 279 GB of raw data
- Database takes up 378 GB on disk with minimal indexes

## Instructions

Before run the benchmark, first the data should be downloaded. As the data is 
not ready for `OmniSciDB`, it will be loaded first to PostgreSQL/PostGIS\*. 
Once the data is completed loaded into PostgreSQL, a script will export data 
from PostgreSQL to `csv` files and it should be loaded to OmniSciDB CPU and GPU.

<small>
* As the original script use the `COPY` command with fields as parameters for 
header, and OmniSciDB doesn't support that yet.

### 1. Install and run databases servers

For this benchmark, OmniSciDB CPU and GPU and PostgreSQL/PostGIS will be installed
inside a conda environment.

#### 1.1 Install and run OmniSciDB-CPU and OmniSciDB-GPU using conda

Check the instructions on the main [README.md](../README.md) file, 
in section `Install and run OmniSciDB-CPU and OmniSciDB-GPU using conda`.


#### 1.2 Install and run PostgreSQL/PostGIS using conda

For installing and running PostgreSQL/PostGIS, in a terminal, run:

```sh
# create a conda environment for postgresql/postgis
# and install postgis with python 3.7
conda create -n postgresql postgis python=3.7
# activate postgresql environment
conda activate postgresql
# initialize the database postgresql and specify the data directory
initdb --username=$(whoami) -D /work/$(whoami)/postgresql-data
# start the postgresql server with the data directory created
postgres -D /work/$(whoami)/postgresql-data

# TODO: specify data directory using environment variable
```

### 2. Download raw data

To download the main data, run the follow code in a terminal:

```sh
# download taxi data 
IBIS_BENCHMARK_DOWNLOAD=/work/$(whoami)/ibis-benchmark-download ./download_raw_data.sh
# remove bad rows
IBIS_BENCHMARK_DOWNLOAD=/work/$(whoami)/ibis-benchmark-download ./remove_bad_rows.sh
```

The `remove_bad_rows.sh` script fixes two particular files that have a few rows with too many columns. 
See the "data issues" section below for more.

Note that the raw data is hundreds of GB, so it will take a while to download.

The [FiveThirtyEight Uber dataset](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response) contains 
Uber trip records from Aprâ€“Sep 2014. Uber and other FHV (Lyft, Juno, Via, etc.) 
data is available since Jan 2015 in the TLC's data.

To download this extra data, run the follow code in a terminal:

```sh
IBIS_BENCHMARK_DOWNLOAD=/work/$(whoami)/ibis-benchmark-download ./download_raw_2014_uber_data.sh
```

### 3. Initialize database and set up schema

`./initialize_database.sh`

### 4. Import taxi, FHV and FiveThirtyEight Uber data

```sh
# import data trip
IBIS_BENCHMARK_DOWNLOAD=/work/$(whoami)/ibis-benchmark-download ./import_trip_data.sh
# import data trip fhv (for-hire vehicle)
IBIS_BENCHMARK_DOWNLOAD=/work/$(whoami)/ibis-benchmark-download ./import_fhv_trip_data.sh
# import uber data
IBIS_BENCHMARK_DOWNLOAD=/work/$(whoami)/ibis-benchmark-download ./import_2014_uber_trip_data.sh
```

The full import process takes ~36 hours on a 2013 MacBook Pro with 16 GB of RAM.

### 5. Analysis

The expressions used by this benchmark are listed into expr_list at `exprs.py`

## Schema

- `trips` table contains all yellow and green taxi trips. Each trip has a `cab_type_id`, which references the `cab_types` table and refers to one of `yellow` or `green`
- `fhv_trips` table contains all for-hire vehicle trip records, including ride-hailing apps Uber, Lyft, Via, and Juno
- `fhv_bases` maps `fhv_trips` to base names and "doing business as" labels, which include ride-hailing app names
- `nyct2010` table contains NYC census tracts plus the Newark Airport. It also maps census tracts to NYC's official neighborhood tabulation areas
- `taxi_zones` table contains the TLC's official taxi zone boundaries. Starting in July 2016, the TLC no longer provides pickup and dropoff coordinates. Instead, each trip comes with taxi zone pickup and dropoff location IDs
- `central_park_weather_observations` has summary weather data by date

## Other data sources

These are bundled with the repository, so no need to download separately, but:

- Shapefile for NYC census tracts and neighborhood tabulation areas comes from [Bytes of the Big Apple](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/districts-download-metadata.page)
- Shapefile for taxi zone locations comes from the TLC
- Mapping of FHV base numbers to names comes from [the TLC](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/FHV-Base-Aggregate-Report/2v9c-2k7f)
- Central Park weather data comes from the [National Climatic Data Center](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/)

## Data issues encountered

- Remove carriage returns and empty lines from TLC data before passing to Postgres `COPY` command
- Some raw data files have extra columns with empty data, had to create dummy columns `junk1` and `junk2` to absorb them
- Two of the `yellow` taxi raw data files had a small number of rows containing extra columns. I discarded these rows
- The official NYC neighborhood tabulation areas (NTAs) included in the census tracts shapefile are not exactly what I would have expected. Some of them are bizarrely large and contain more than one neighborhood, e.g. "Hudson Yards-Chelsea-Flat Iron-Union Square", while others are confusingly named, e.g. "North Side-South Side" for what I'd call "Williamsburg", and "Williamsburg" for what I'd call "South Williamsburg". In a few instances I modified NTA names, but I kept the NTA geographic definitions
- The shapefile includes only NYC census tracts. Trips to New Jersey, Long Island, Westchester, and Connecticut are not mapped to census tracts, with the exception of the Newark Airport
